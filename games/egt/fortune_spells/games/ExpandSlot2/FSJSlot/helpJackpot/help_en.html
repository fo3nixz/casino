<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Fortune Spells video slot is a 5-reel, 10-line game.

</p>
<h2 id="how_to_bet">How to Bet</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Number of lines to play with is being selected. The selection is made through the panels located on both sides of the screen.</li>
	<li>A wagering denomination (coin value) can be chosen by clicking any of the four denomination buttons.</li>
	<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking any of the five bet buttons in the lower center of the screen. The amount displayed on each of the bet buttons is the bet amount for the selected number of lines. When activating any of the bet buttons the player selects a bet and starts a game at the same time. Activation of those buttons is also possible by pressing „C“, „V“, „B“, „N“ and „M” buttons from the keyboard. Pressing „C“ button places the smallest bet, pressing „V“ button places next bet and so on.</li>
	<li>In case the Paytable is open, the amounts related to the chosen bet value are shown. If the player presses any of the remaining bet buttons, a bet selection is made alone and the relevant payouts are shown in the Paytable. Only upon second activation of the same button the game is started.</li>
	<li>When opening the game at first, the lowest bet button is always selected by default.</li>
	<li>If when activating a bet field there is a sum that was won, the animation of the increasing amount won in the “Win” field stops and the whole amount won is visualized.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gamble_feature">Gamble Feature</h2>
<p>
	In case of a winning, the player is given the option to access the Gamble round, by pressing the active button “Gamble”.<br/>
	Gamble feature activates when Gamble screen is open and the card in the middle of the screen is face down and flashes red and black. The label “Gamble Attempts Left” shows the number of trials the player has for this game. 
	The label “Gamble Amount” shows the amount the player would like to double in the game Gamble. The label “Gamble to Win” shows the amount which a player could win if he/she guesses the color of the card. 
	There are two buttons to select: “Red” and “Black”. Clicking the “Black” button is also possible by clicking the „&#x21E8“ from the keyboard. Clicking the “Red” button is also possible by clicking the „&#x21E6“ from the keyboard. When selecting "Black" or "Red", the card is moved up in the screen and is kept as history. Last five cards from the player's session are kept in the History section.<br/>
	If the player has guessed the color of the card, a new card appears in the middle of the screen face down and flashes red and black. This process continues until the player makes a wrong guess. The sum from field “Gamble Amount” is shown in the field “Win”. 
	If the player wishes to end the game “Gamble”, he/she activates the button “Collect”. The screen closes and the amount from the field “Win” is transferred to the field “Balance”. 
	If the player does not guess the color of the card, the game Gamble ends, and the player loses the amount. The screen closes up. The amount from the field “Win” is lost, and does not add up to the Balance.<br/>
	The maximum amount won that can be brought to the Gamble round is given in the Paytable.
</p>
<h2 id="game_controls">Game Controls</h2>
<p>
	
	Following fields appear on the screen of the Fortune Spells slot:<br/>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="game_controls_items">“Balance/Credit”</span> - upon activation of this field, the player switches from credit to currency which he/she has chosen to play with. This is also valid when switching from currency to credit. The activation of this button is possible at all stages of the game;</li>
		<li><span class="game_controls_items">“Win”</span> – this field displays the total amount won from the lines at one rotation of the reels. If, while the animation of the increasing amount goes, “Collect” button is activated, the animation stops and the amount won for this rotation of the reels is shown;</li>
		<li><span class="game_controls_items">“Last Win”</span> – this field displays the last winning amount from the game;</li>
		<li><span class="game_controls_items">Win Line field</span> – this field is located below the reels. It shows the line number, the winning combination and the amount the player won from that combination;</li>
		<li><span class="game_controls_items">Panels for lines selection and visualization of number of lines</span> – they are located on both sides of the screen. The selection of number of lines happens as follows: the player should select one of the values from the panels: 1, 3, 5, 7 or 10. The currently selected lines are colored in a different color than the rest of the lines. The number of lines cannot be changed while the reels are rotating, during Autoplay, Gamble and Free Spins mode. In case a sum is won, when changing the number of lines the amount won is added directly to the player's balance, and the gamble option is not given to the player.</li>
